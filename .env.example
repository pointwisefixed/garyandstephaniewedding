# Environment Variables for Production Deployment
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
# DO NOT commit .env to git - it's in .gitignore

# Required for production - Rails master key for decrypting credentials
# Get this from: cat config/master.key
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=your-32-character-master-key-here

# Rails environment
RAILS_ENV=production
RAILS_LOG_LEVEL=info

# Database (if using PostgreSQL instead of SQLite)
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/wedding_production

# Note: SMTP and other secrets are now stored in encrypted credentials
# Edit credentials with: EDITOR=nano rails credentials:edit
# No need for SMTP_* environment variables anymore!
